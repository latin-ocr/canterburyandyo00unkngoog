The Cantilupe family. iii

Castle of Hereford, as Antony Wood supposed, ² but at his
father’s manor of Hamildene² in Buckinghamshire‚⁸ where a
chapel was built in his memory by the Earl of Cornwall.
He had four brothers3 of these william, the third baron,
was seneschal of Gascony‚ Hugh became archdeacon of Glou-
cester, and John and N icholas were knights. Two of ‘his sistere
passed into noble families: J uliana marrying Robeoet de Tregoz,

and Agnes becoming the wife of baron St. John. A third was
betrothed, if not married to baron Robert Gregonet.

His mother died probably soon aster his birth, for he was
brought up by a noble matron of saintly character, and
entrusted at the age of seven, wit-‚h his brother Hugh, to
the religious training of good teachers. While his father's
time was taken up by affairs of state and attendance on
the King, the boy was much left to the fostering care‘ and
guardianship of his uncle Walter, the high-minded Bishop of
worcester. We may estimato the nature of his influence upon
his nephew’s character, if we note the part which he took
in the social history of his age as well as in the adminis-
tration of his diocese. The heads of the family⁴ had borne

the vilest and the most unstable of the preceding occupante
of the throne, but Walter of Worcester (bishop 1236-1265)
was a distinguished patriot as well as a sage and exemplary
prelato. Staunch friend of Grosseteste, and resolute like him
to control with a firm hand the spiritual interests of his
diocese, he took a prominent part in the baronial movement
against the misrule of the Court, and never faltered in his
adherence to the popular cause. He said mass for Simon de
Montfort on the battle field of Evesham,⁶ having refused
before to excommunicate him at the bidding of the Papal
Legate. He was, says an annalist,⁶ so high in moral virtues
above the level of his contemporarieS‚ that but for this one
