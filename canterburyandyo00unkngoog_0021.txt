But the Rhe-toric of the Triviam then included more of the
real literature of the Latin writers, and its influence is
seen in the more graceful style of a. John of Salisbury or
Giraldus. The wider outlook of the next century was
mainly in Philosophy, for the ban pronounced a while against
much of Aristotle's works was removed when the Cantilupes
were not long settled in their course of study; but for
some time they were chiefly occupied with grammar and logic,
with a sparing admixture of psychology. Only later in their
terms could they attend -the lectures in the ethics and the
other treatises of the Greek‘ Philosopher.

This one-sided training is reflected in the literary style.
It cannot be said that the letters of Popes and Bishops
included in this Register are models of graceful composition.
The Lecturers for their part were careless of literary finish;
their main object was to divide and sub-divide the theme,
and to distinguish and define, that the whole might be
mapped out with minute precision. They were hampered also
by the scholars’ natural desire to take it 211 down as from
dictation‚ notwithstanding the directions which from time to
time were ineffectus-Hy given. Books were few3 scholare often
were very poor, and anxious to make a library of note-books. But

- ,. if the clm had to squat upon the floor, like Arab children,

as was said to be the good old custom,¹ they could not
find it easy to write their notes at large.

There was one side of University life in which the
Cantilupes were not likely to take part 3 they would not be
found in the taverns of the suburbe, drinking ‘ good sweet
wine,' and quarrelling with the vintner, like the studente at
the Bourg saint-Marcel in 1229,² whose frey with the citizens
and the police brought about a general secession to other seats
of study, which ended after two years of dispersion in the
enlargement of their academie privileges, and the discomfiture
of their opponents. For the brothers came ‘ en grands seigneurs‚'
with a considerable following, under the charge of a Master of
Arts, who ,was afterwards seneschal of Bishop Walter. Their life

was exemplary and devout‚ as vouched for in later days by
