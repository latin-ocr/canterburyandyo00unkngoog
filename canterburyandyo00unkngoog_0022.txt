a member of the household‚¹ with early masses and ample
benefactions' to the poor.

Canon Robert le Wyse of Glouccster‚ one of the witnesses
who gave 'evidence after the Bishop's death, spoke of his
‘ inception ' in Arts at Paris. If the term was used in ifle
strict sense, it implied that two years after he ‘ determined ’
or became a Bachelor‚ he presented himself for examinatinn,
conducted a disputation in the ‘ Quodlibets‚' and applied for
the formal licence from the Chancellor by which he became
qualified to begin (incipere) to teach in the Faculty of Arts.
The whole course therefore would have lasted some six or
seven years, ending with the inaugural disputation‚ and with
the customary banquet to the Masters at his expense, which
could not be dispensed with, and had to be followed by forty
days of continuone dispntatim, and a residence of some years
as lecturer‚ if this last was not formally excused.

Meantime some steps were taken in the ecclesiastical
career. Benefices were bestowed -upon him by his uncle as
well as by other patrone. In Feb. 1244 a Papal dispensa·
tion allowed him to hold another benefice besides Wintring-
ham which he already had, and ,this was followed by a
further grant which enabled the two brothers, ‘ whose nobility,
learning, and elegance of manners speak for them‚’ to enjoy
more preferment.² By the practice of the age this would
not carry with it any obligation of continued residence in
England‚ or indeed of Holy Orders beyond the earlier stagm,
but the evidence of friends and admirers at a later date
implies in his case a more than usual regard for the respon-
sibflitiee incurres. ’

The First Council of Lyons⁴ in 1245 which he attended,
like his brother, in the capacity of Papal Chaplain‚ must have
supplied further materiale to mature his judgment. Innocent
IV, who summoned it, had been in humbletr rank the partisan
and seeming friend of Frederick ΙΙ, but, by a change of
attitude more complete that that of Becket, 116 now called
the representatives of Christendom together to crush and to
dethrone his rival. No large numbers answered to the call,
for the Emperor’s power was paramount over wide regions,
