viii Introduction.

and many were afraid or disinclined to stir against him. But
under Papal encouragement jealousies and animosities found a
ready voice ς the partisans of Innocent clamoured down Thaddeus
of Susa, the eloquent advocate of Frederick‚ and the Pope
declared the Emperor deposed. Striking as was the scene
when the prelates turned their to-rches downwards after the
sentence of excommunication,l there were other proceedings
which had more interest for the eyes and ears of the
Englishmen who were present. A little company of delegates
—with baron Cantilupe among them2—were there to read the
summary of grievacnces which they were commissioned to lay
before the Council. It was a long and bitter indictment of
Papal exactions and misrule from which England had long
suffered, but which had reached their climax lately in the
conduct of the Papal agent Martin. Swarms of aliens
intruded by provisione into the dignities and richest benefices
of the Church ; the neglect of charity and ministrations in
the parishes burdened with such incumbente 3 the non-obstante
clause which set aside all promises and pledges in favour of
the applicant who could o-utbid competitore by interest or
bribes; heavy contributions levied on churches and convents
by compact between Pope'and King3 the endowments of pious
founders diverted to objects wholly foreign to their wishes 3
the unexampled greediness and insolence of the Papal delegate
—these were the grievances on which the Magnates and
Commons of England were agreed, to the exposure of which
Walter Cantilupe of Worcester must have listened with
entire approval.⁸ His nephews may have heard in earlier
years Grosseteste and their uncle in their friendly intercourse
deplore the prevalent abuses, but such impressions were likely
to be weakened by years of study spent in Paris ; now they
would be revived and deepened by ’ the weighty words which
Innocent listened to in silence, postponing an answer which
was never given. There was further talk of immunities to be
granted to CrusaderS‚ but the Crusade which the Head of the
Church had most at heart was one against the crowned
heretic at home, and on this were spent the energy and
treasure called for repeatedly in the interest of the Holy

Land.
