The Study os civil Law. ix

Whatever the English Chaplain may have felt on the
matters brought before the Gouncil; however they may have
influenced his later judgment‚ little can have found utterance
from him at the time, for marks of Papal favour followed
shortly in several Bulls which sanctioned the possession of the
benefices which he held together, in contravention of the
requirements of the Canons.¹ He was allowed moreover by
dispensation to pursue the study of the Civil Law, which had
been prohibited at Paris in 1219 by Honorius III, as endan·
gering the paramount importance of Theology in that great
University. While banished from that centre, and also
formally withheld in 1254 from clerical dignitaries and
regulare, except by special favour, by letter of Innocent IV,
it- did not, however, lose its popularity elsewhere. Matthew
Paris, a few years later, refers to the young scholar-s of the
day, forsaking the liberal Arts and the study of Philosophy,
and hurrying in crowds to the Lecture-Halls of the civilians,
as the avenue to posts of dignity and profit.⁵¹ Friar Bacon
spoke with bitterness of the rewards by which the study
was encouraged. ‘⁸ In the Church of God a civilian‚ though
acquainted with civil Law alone, and ignorant of Canon law,
is more praised and promoted to ecclesiastical dignities than
a Master in Theology. . . . would to God I could see
these quibbles and frauds of the jur-ists banished from the
Church, and causes decided as they were forty years back,
without all this rattle of legislation. . . . Then the study
of Theology, of Canon Law, of Philosophy, would be exalted
and perfected3 then the princes and prelatos would give bene·
fices and riehes to Professors in this high Faculty. . . . But
civilians‚ and lawyers handling the Canon law like civilians
now· a· days receive all the good things of the Church. . .
Thus the whole study of Philosophy goes to ruin, and with
it the whole regimen of the Church3 peace is driven from
the earth, justice denied‚ and evils of all kinds ensue.''⁸

The study however, which was forbidden at Paris, was
freely allowed to nearly all at Orleans, which had ranked
befor‘e chiefly as a School of Letters, but now became the
main resort of all who did not care to travel so far as to
