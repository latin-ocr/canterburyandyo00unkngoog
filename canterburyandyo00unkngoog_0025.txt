Bologna or to Padua. Not indeed that it had independent
‘corporate rightS, though Matthew Paris speaks of it ae a
scholarium universitas ,·¹ ”it wae subject in some· respecta to
the authority of the Bishop and the Scholastieue of the
Cathedral, till Clement V in 1306 removed the eeclesiastical
restrictione, and conferred on it the constitutional right to
organise iteelf by Statutes of its own, and elect ite ten Prot-,tore
of the Student Natione.2 Thither therefore went Cantilupe,⁸
and made euch progress in hie legal studies that he was able
at times to take the pleee of the Professor Gnido, whose
leoturee· he hed attended; after hie death it was reported by
a Canon of Hereford that, on one of those occasions of which
not-iee had been given, a member of the Claes dreamed the
night before that the Lecturer was eeated in the Professor’e
ehair with a mitre on his head.⁴

After acquiring the knowledge of civil Law⁶ at Orleane‚
which must have been a matter of some years, he returned
to Parie, where hie brother had remained in the Faculty of
Theology meantime ; he then began the study of Canon Law‚

had drawn up hie great text-book of authorities on the quee-
tione with which the ecclesiastieal courte oould be concerned,
putting therein the deerees of the Popes on the same level
ae the Canens of the General Gonnoils. The development of
the Roman law had served as a model for thie code, and the
studies at Orleans were therefore a fitting groundwork and pre·
paration for those which were to follow. The two brothers did
not now live together, but each had a separate houeehold on
an ample scale, with devotional exeroises and abundant oharitiee
as before.

In the Lectum-Helle of the Professore of Canon law
Thomas was sure to meet some of his fellow-eountrymen of
equal rank and means, for the Faculty specially attracted the
young Archdeaoons and other dignitariee‚ aa well as the holdere
of rich benefioes who had lieenees of non-residenee from their
