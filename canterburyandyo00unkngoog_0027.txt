xii Introduction.

What Cantilupe had learned at Paris and at Orleans
he came, we are told, to teach at Oxford. It was a common
practice in his age for men who loved a life of letters to
pass from one University to another, and ‘ gladly learn and
gladly‘ teach' in various scats of learning. His contemporary
Peckham‚ for example, went in early youth to Paris, was
reader in Divinity at Oxford, returned to Paris, and was
lecturer afterwards at Rome. Young studente, attracted by a
European reputation, sought their Professors wherever they could
find them. So the earnest-minded crowded round the sages
of old Greece3 travelled from place to place to make themselves
discipl-es of some famous teacher3 and hung upon his lips to get

more light, if might be, on the eternal problems of men's destiny
and duty.

There are apparently no data as to the exact time at
which Cantilupe transferred his residence to Oxford, but he must
have been there some years before the highest office in the Uni-
versity was conferred upon him, one not likely to be given to
a stranger little known. There was some excitement in men’s
minds there, which might remind him of what he had been
familiar with at· Paria. The University resented the renewed
attempts of the· Diocesan, the Bishop of Lincoln, to exorciso
authority from which ' it claimed to have been set free, and
in 1256 a deputation of nine “Artists”-—as Wood calls thern—-
laid their grievances before the King. Matthew Paris, who
'had frequent access to the royal presence, warned him, as he
tells us, to be careful of the critical condition of the Church,—
“ The University of Paris, foster-mother of so many holy
prelates, is in no slight perturbation; if Oxford, the second
school of the Church, or rather its mainstay‚ be at the same
time disturbed in the same way, there is danger of total ruin
·to it.” “ Heaven forbid that,'' said Henry, “most of all in
my days.”¹ A compromise was accordingly arranged, with
terms of peace. There was greater trouble still in 1258 .
Feuds of long standing between rival factions issued in a
general fray between the Northerners, aided by the Welsh,
and the Southerners, and in this a brother of the Welsh Princo
was killed, and many were seriously wounded. In their fear
of the King’s displeasure they proposed to give large peace·
