that 116 valued the life of any of his subjecte too highly for
any price that could be paid. But the disturbancee of the realm,
and the warlike movemente that ensued‚ diverted attention from
Academic questione, though in the Lent following there was
renewed offence, in the rescue of 6 criminal who with eid of
scholare broke out of prison, aud sought sanctuary, and abjured
the kingdom. The affrey at Oxford was 6 prolude to more

A deed of conveyanoe of ground belonging to the Abbey
of Oseney to the Fratres de Penitentia was attested in 1262 by
Thomas de Gantilupe 66 chanaana, but we are not told how

discipline with which he disarmed unruly studente, end main-
