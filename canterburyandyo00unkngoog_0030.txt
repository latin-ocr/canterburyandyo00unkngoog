that his promise to observe them was not binding on his con-
science. In face of his growing strength the barons were waver-
ing and divided, and with the King‘s consent agreed to refer the
constitutional question to the arbitration of Louis IX of France‚
in order to avert “the havoc and irreparable losses with which
the whole land was threatened.”² Cantilupe was chosen as one

of the six advocatae, who were to plead the barons’ cause before
the King of· Franco.

At the conierence oi AmienS, where King Leuis sat in
state, Hem-y and his Queen were present, with notable sup-
porters like Bishop Peter of Hereford, who after rough handling
in his own Cathedral, and imprisonment at Eaffdisley, had
fied to France for safety. Simon de Montfort had broken his
thigh-bone on the way, and the Magnetes of his party failed
to appear, while for several days the representatives on both

which the Ordinances of Oxford did but confirm. 'l'he fence
of words was soon followed by the clash of arms, and the
barone triumphed on the battlefield of Lewes. While they
governed in the King's name, the offices oi State passed, as
a matter of course, into the hands of men whom they could
trust. From being Ohancellor of Oxford Cantilupe rose to
be Chancellor of the King, and received the Great Seal on
Feb. 25, 1265.⁸ He b’ore a name associated in the King’s
memor-y with many acts of loyal service, and for the sake of
father and grandfather he willingly (qratanter) accepted, as he
said, the choice which others made. ‘⁴ He folded the Patent
