as the Scribe noted in the Patent Bou} A grant of five
hundred marks a year was made, to include the support of
the Clerks of the Royal Chancery. The Boll of the house-
hold expenses of the Countess of Leicester contains an inci-
dental notice at this time that illustrates the ruling influence
which determined his appointment. On March lst there is an
entry of a complimentary gift of wine sent to the Chancellor at
Salisbury, and a special messenger was despatched with letters
