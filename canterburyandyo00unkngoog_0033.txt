xviii Introduction.

11116 First. The Chair of St. Peter was now filled by 11116
noble-minded Gregory X„ whose schemes of ambition centred
in the rescue of 11116 Holy Land, which was 116 follow on the
union of a divided Christendom. Bishops and dignified eccle—
siastics flocked in crowds from every quattor 116 take part
in 11116 166666111611166 of the Greek and Roman Churches, and
in 11116 furtherance of ecclesiastical reforms. Among them came
11116 mature scholar 1111111 personal experience enough of civil
strife and a disorganized Ohurch 611 home 116 welcome gladly
11116 1116616 of peace and 116166, with beneficenss safeguards and
corrections, which were laid before 11116 06116611. Η6 may have
met a great Archbishop who was also there, Eudes Rigaud of
Rouen, who was well-known 116 have been indefatigable for
years in 11116 visitat-‚ion of his diocese, as described in his journal
in minute 11611611.ι Τ116 memory of his resolute example was
perhaps 6611 lost on 0661111696, who 1611611 have heard in early
days of 11116 artifices by which the monks of Tewkesbury evaded
his uncle's questions when he came on his unwelcome visita-
111666. At 11116 06116611 116661166611 reforms were in 11116 611·;
but soon 11116 guiding 6911111 of 11116 1661616661, passed away, and
with him 11116 brighb visions of 11116 Kingdom of God, and
11116 hopes of enduring progress. But 11116 frequent references 116
the Gouncil in 11116 pages of 111116 volume shew 1111611 some prac—
111661 611696 were taken without delay 116 grapple with 11116 61111666
of Ghurch Order, and 1111611 0661111696 16 11116 611161616111611166 of
his diocese was entirely loyal 116 the regulations framed 611
Lyons. The efficiency of the parochial system had been fatally
enfeebled. Churches were given in commendam ‚· 1111611· custody
was entrusted 116 laymen, who might have no intention to
proceed immediately, or even 611 611, to Holy Orders; patrous
presented their children 116 rich beneficos while they were still
boys 611 6611661; foreigners‚ by provision from 11116 Ρ696,
claimed 11116 enjoymenfi of 11116 11111166 of parishes in which they
never lived. Ι11 was some check on· these abuses when the
06116611 decreed 1111611 116 unqualified person should be admitted
to 11116 custody of any church for more 111166 six 1116611116 611 6
time; 1111611 those presented 116 6 benefice who were in minor
Orders should be bound 116 proceed in due course to 11116 9116611-
hood; and bhatz residence should be enforced 61166911 after
