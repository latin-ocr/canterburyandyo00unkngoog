visited several times during the period of his episcopato, was
in the patronage of the St. John family, afterwards lords of
Basing‚ into one branch of· which his sister Agnes married.
Το this must be added the benefice of BradwelL¹ in the diocese
of London, which perhaps was given in pursuance of an indult
granted by the Pope in 1245, and addressed to the Bishop of
London.² He had doubtless canonical dispensatione to hold all
these together, and the public opinion of the age condoned the
’ practice, excepting when the endowmcnts were enjoyed by aliens
abroad. Our informants, who were personal friends or members
of his household, were careful to assure us that he was most
exemplary in his regard for the responsibilities of the various
charges which he held. He travelled frequently, they said,
from one parish to another, and this implies perhaps long
intervals between his terms of residence at Paris or at Oxford;
he would have vicars who could preach well and do their duty;
he shewed open-handed hospitality, and dispensed liberal alms·
giving to the poor with thoughtful and delicate discrimination.
The buildings on the glebes were substantially maintained, and
the rights of the church upheld, even at the eost of
occasional litigation.⁸ He had ample means indeed for this,
for his revenue from these appointments was estimated at a
thousand marks, and he spent little on himself for his personal
comfort.

Little is told us in detail of what he did besides
during this short period of his pastoral activity. At Court he
had been soon pardoned for allowing himself to be forced as
Chancellor upon the King. He was made a member of the
Council by the succeeding Monarch; in Feb„ 1274, the
Sheriff of Oxiord was instructed to hand over to his keeping
certain brawlers there who had been arrested foi· grave
offences ;⁴ and he was named in company with Ralph de·
Hengham and others as a judge.⁶ Meanwhile family affairs
claimed some of his attention. He had lost in 1265 his uncle
Walter, for whom he acted as executor.⁶ His nephew George
