xxii Introduction.

the name was then uncommon, perhaps suggested by that of
Becket,¹ unlikely as it seems.

'I'he Chapter appears to have been left unusually free to
act, and their choico was accepted by both King and Pope.
'I'he Consecration took place on September 81:11, but only the
Bishops of London and Rochester were present with the Primate
at the ceremony. The Registers of Bronescombe of Exeter and
Godfrey Giffard of Worcester contain their letters of apology sent
to Archbishop Kilwardby, but he did not conceal his annoyance²

at the scant courtesy shewn by the prelatos in the neighbouring
Sees⁸ to one whom he had himself delighted to honour at

Oxford‚ and of whom he speaks in warm terms soon afterwards
in his letter to Prince Llewelyn.⁴

Meanwhile the Bishop of Worcester had written to him in
June to promise that, if he were allowed to collate to all the
benefices which Cantilupe held of the Bishop’s patronage, the
same 'should be restored to him in case he should not be con-

are given us ;ω and this also was observed and enlarged by some

of his successor-s.u
One of the first acts of the ⁴ Elect of Hereford,' as he is

styled‚ was to write to the Chapter to deploro the scandale
caused by the two rival claimants to the office of Deam who
