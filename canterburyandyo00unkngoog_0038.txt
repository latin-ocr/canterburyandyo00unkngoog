The influerwe of Peter de Aquablcmca. ' xxiii

disturbed the peace of the Gathedral and the city by the
feuds between their partisanS, and the excommunicatione whieh
were seattered freely in their names ;¹ while the corrective
jurisdiction over the whole Deanery was, to his grief, entirely
in abeyance? The animosities in question began at a much
earlier date, and to understand them fully we must go back
to the times of Peter de Aquablanca, who ruled the diocese
from 1240 to 1268. A Savoyard favourite of Henry ΙΙΙ, he
was long his trusted minister in affairs of state, employed in
many confidential errands, and among others in the unserupu—
lous artifice, as it was regarded, by which the elergy and
religious houses were pledged unwittingly to pay large sums to
Pope and King; this caused the good hater, Matthew Paris, to
say of him that his memory exhaled a sulphurous steneh.⁸
Not content with the widespread odium thus provoked, he
engaged in a long quarrel with his Chapter, binding them with
Papal sanctions to six months' residence on their prebends,⁴
though himself for long periods absent from his dioeese, and
further disputing their rights of property and customary claims.⁶
Meanwhile a swarm of kinsmen and fellow-eountrymen had
followed him to Hereford, and with his help were quartered
in the dignities and beneficos of the See. Here as elsewhere
the rapid rise of the intrudere was resented‚ for it must be
owned that Englishmen at this time was fiercely intolerant of
the foreigners amongst them. For their dislike of the Poitevin
and Savoyard favourites of the King there was indeed good
reason, as also of Italians who drew large sums by Papal pro-
vision from their churches; but we may judge of their narrowed
sympathies when we find Spaniards spoken of as ‘⁸ hideous in
their personS, contemptible in their dreSS, and detestable in their
manners.''⁶

At Hereford the presence of this intruded element caused

much beart-buming‚ and at times unseemly strife even within

2-As a territorial expression. the Deanery included eighteen narishes. with ehaoelries

presented by the nati-ons were instituted by the Dean: the churches were visited by him:
the matrimonial and testamentary business passed through the hands oi* his officials:
and he had also powers of coen-cive discipline in faith and moi-als which brought him
into relation with all classes of the neople. 1t was the suspension of these which
Cantilune so much regretted. Even as late as the eighteenth century apparitors went to
and {roz offenders were summoned: and penitents in doleful guise were forced to confess
their sins in Church before the congregation.
