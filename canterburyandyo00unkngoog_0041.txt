him, long after Cantflupe and others concerned had passed
away.

Besides John there were other members of the Aquablanca
family of whom the Register makes mention, and commonly
with some note of disfavour or of ill-repute. Emeric,¹ the
Chaucellor, claimed · the patronage of All Saints’ and St.
Martin's in Hereford‚ as the representative of his 'brother John,
ejecting the existing Vicat who pathetically appealed to his
Diocesan for justice.¹² Their uncle had in earlier days possessed
himself of the advowson of St. Peter’s‚ to which he had no
right ς but after some time he formally renounced the claim.⁸
A third brother, Aymon‚ also a canon, is mentioned in the
will of John. Their nephew James⁴ had been made Arch-
deacon of Salop while still a schoolboy and had held this
office, with more preferment‚ while away for five years at his
studies.⁶ For some unna-med offence sentence of deprivation
was passed upon him, and after many citations from the
Bishop⁶ he formally resigned his place. William de Conflens‚'¹
Archdeacon of Hereford‚ william de Gruyere‚⁸ Precentor of
Lausanne‚ and Martin de 'Gaye,⁹ who were canons, are known to
have come from the same region, and there is no doubt that the
Chapter was well packed with Bishop Peter's countrymen and
partisans. To these may be added others of the beneficed
clergy, like Peter and Pontius de Salius, (dits de Cors) of
Coeur, ²⁰ near Aquablanca, nephews αἱ Dean John, who were
repeatedly summoned by Cantilupe for non-residence and con-
tumacy in non-appearance.¹² Cantor-in, a physician of Bishop
Peter, had been promised a benefice by the King‚¹¹ and is found
afterwards at Eastnor as Rector.²⁸ Gerard of Eugines‚ Rector
of Colwall,¹⁴ Peter de Vesino,¹⁶ Martin de Chambery,¹⁶ Hugh
