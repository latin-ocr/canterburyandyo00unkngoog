xxviii Introduction.

During the Civil War the surrounding district was occupied by
Llewelyn, encouraged by the barem, and part of it was now
reclaimed by Cantilupe, as belonging to the episcopal estates,
no regard being paid by him to the repeated seizure of it in
earlier days in the King's name. This included C‘hastroke,
now called Castle Wright, Aston‚ and Muliton now Mellington.¹
Strong lettere, one after another, demanded the unconditional
surrender of these landS, under pain of the gravest spiritual
censuros² The Archbishop of Canterbury was induced to write
in the same spirit to urge restitution.³ The critical condition '
of the Prinee a little later, and his final overthrow decided . the
question of his claim, but it appears that the tenants of the
’ disputed lands would not recognise the Bishop’s title, and he
wrote repeatedly to denounce the malcontent8.⁴

In another suit Cantilupe resolutely braved the resentment
of the great baron, whose support had given to Prince Edward
the crowning victory of Evesham. Grilbert de Clare, Earl of
Gloucester‚ had taken possession with his foresters of the
episcopal Chase of Eastnor and Colwall above Ledbury‚ which
had been given to the See by King Medruth with confirmation
from Pope Innocent 11.;³ and this without protest apparently
from John le Breton. His successor lost no time in insisting
on his rights. The Earl was summoned to defend his trespass
(Oct, 1275), but his great influence intimidated at first the
local officers ; many adjournments were allowed, which delayed
the issue for two years. At length by the King's order the
Earl's foresters were withdrawn ς the Bishop, to assert his right,
was allowed to hunt over the Chase 3 after which the Sheriff
took possession of ‘che woods. A writ was issued‚ in obedience
to which the J ustices came to hold an inquest 3 a jury viewed
the lands and decided in the Bishopv's favour in J an., 1278.
His servants many years afterwards had much to tell of the
final scene in the long debate; how the Earl appeared in force
with armed temnere, bidding the Bishop know that no
sorry .shaveling should take from him what he and his
ancestors had ‚long enjoyed in peace3 then handing to the
J ustices what purported to be a royal writ to postpone the
proceedings and dismiss the jury. The Bishop, it is said,
