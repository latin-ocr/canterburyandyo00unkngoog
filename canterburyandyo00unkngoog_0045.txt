xxx Introduction.

Cantilupe that much of a district called Longa Memida eon-
taining from five 10 seven miles of pasturage had been
annexed.1 At, his instance therefore a writ was issued, and
a perambulation of the land in disputo was arranged for March,
1278. A jury of belted knights was summoned, 11111 several
were challenged by Peter 00111615, and 15116 1661 refused 10 act
without. the due number of knights. At. length, after remon·
straneas and threats of fines, a proper perambulation was made,
and 15116 boundaries fixed.²

Before Cantilupe's consecration he wrote 10 1116 civic
authorities of Hereford 10 beg them 10 respect 1116 rights and
privileges of 1116 cathedral and 116 clergy.⁸ There had been
much friction in 1116 past 3 there were 10 116 many quarrels in
1116 future 3 and later pages of our Register illusi-‚rate in some
detail 1116 causes that, led repeatedly 10 0011161011 and disputes.
The variety of conflicting jurisdictione accounbed for much of
15116 ill-feeling. The Church-land and 1116 city-land: 15116 King's
men and 1116 Bishop's men were marked off from each 011161
by their different rights and obligations ,- there was distinct
assize of bread and beer3 1116 shopkeepers' privileges differed in
each 3 1116 power of 1116 Mayor stopped short at 1116 precincts of 1116
01066 ; and law-days were held in 1116 Canons' Bake-house for
1116 Bishop's Fee, or for 11161 part. of it inside 1116 1111611166
which was called afterwards 1116 Canons' Fee, within which 15116
city 00116161116 could make no arrest. Each prebend had indeed
in some respects like independence, and claims for 1156 own law-
days and assize. Disturbers of 1116 peace passed 10 a different
police system when they crossed a street, 10 1116 grave risk of
security and order. Some houses were partly in 1116 Canons'
fee and parbly in 1116 King's fee, and knavish occupants could
transfer their furniture from one side 10 1116 other, and so balk
1116 civic officers when they came 10 levy (1161161111 upon their
goods. Collision between such vested rights was unavoidable,
and in Bishop Peber's 1511116 111616 was much 1101 disputo, after
which a formal memorandum of agreement was drawn up, and
enrolled by Royal mandate, November, 1262. of this a copy
was enbered in our Register, called for doubtless by friction
existing ab 1116 time.⁴ Again 1116 exclusive privileges of 1116
