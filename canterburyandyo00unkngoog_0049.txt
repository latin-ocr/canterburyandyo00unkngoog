There was a disputo also with another neighbouring prolate,
the Bishop of St. David's, who claimed the right to consecrate
the church of Abbey Dore, as pertaining to his See, and was
supported by baron Tregoz, a nephew of Cantilupe, who had
pecuniary interests at stake. These, however, had no effect
upon his uncle's judgment‚ nor was he deterred by the show
of military force assembled3 he resolutely proceeded on 1118 way,
under protection 01 1118 escort, and completed the ceremony at
some personal risk. Finally after reference to the 1811-0011118,
the question was decided in his favour.1
