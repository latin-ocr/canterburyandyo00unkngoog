chureh in which they had established rights.· Aa in many other
cases the townspeople and the monks shared the use of the
same building, but at Leominster there was no solid partition
between the two portione, and to screen the conventual rooms
from trespassers the monks often closed the outer doors at
times when fugitives fied thither for sanctuary and priests
needed the viaticum. It was believed also that the customary
almsgiving had been curtailed and endowments misapplied. The
Bishop wrote repeatedly and in strong lang-uage on these

change on which he had insisted was cancelled afterwards by
Archbishop Peckham, who ordered that a chapel¹ should be
built not far away for the needs which have been mentioned.
At a later period of the Bishop’s rule there was much scandal

women.a The Abbot of Reading resisted episcopal interference
with the priory‚ claiming the exclusive right of placing and
displacing the members of the cell. This led to somewhat

these perhaps should be recalled.⁸ At Chirbury there had been
notorious scandals from the free access of women and others
