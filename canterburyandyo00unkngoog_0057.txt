xlii Introduction.

We must infer indeed from the itinerary that in England,
and later on in France, he accepted almost perforce the hos·
pitality of the religious houses on his read, when he passed
beyond the confines of his diocese. They were the recognized
hostelries of the Middle Ages ; when they sued for the appro-
priation of the parishes of which they were the patrona they
insisted often on this bui-den, and a Constitution of Othobon
enforced the obliga-tion in such cases to provide convenient
houses to entertain their guestS.¹

There is little evidence of continuone residence at Hereford,
or of much use of the Hall, which then served more
as a court-house than a Palace.¹ These frequent movements
to and fro and this variety of homes may explain the insertion
of so many transcripte of much earlier chartei-s. They were
needed for reference at times when the originale could not be
consulted‚ or were only to be found in different places, There
was no Bishop’s Registry in Hereford itself3 some documenta, we
know, were deposited for safety in the Chapter House of the Cathe-
dral? like the thousands of private charters, quite unconnected
with the ecclesiastical estates, which were stored there for
safety during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries‚ and still
exist among the Archives. Others were placed—strange as it
appears—behind the High Altar of St. Paul’s in London,⁴ and
when the Bishop was leaving England, he wrote to the Dean
and Chapter to beg that his representatives might have access
to his deede! Some perhaps were left in the maner houses
at Sugwas and elsewhere, and this may explain the loss of
most of the originale, while many of the charters of the Dean
and Chapter are preserved.

It has been noted that little regard is paid to chronological
order in the arrangement of the various enti-ies. Some appear

to have been put in at hap-hazard 3 but the most marked irregu-
larity is due to the insertion of the copies of letters and gmnts
of earlier Kings and Bishops, or the records of proceedings in
the Courts, for which search had been made in connexion with
some passing need. Disputes with the town, for example, would
lead to inquiry into' the privileges granted and confirmed by
various monarchs‚⁶ as also to the formal agreements made which

were afterwards enrolled by myal order.¹¹
