Claims made by officers of the Crown for the artem of
subsidies or scuta-ges from the Episcopal estates may account for
the lengthy copies of financial statements connected with Peter
de Aquablanca and John le Breton.² Any question raised as
to the char-itable distribution of the corn charged on the
manor of Holme Lacy might cause the clerk to hunt up the
original deed of the endowment of Bishop Peter, and write it

of the preceding prelate would require reference to the arrange-
