of the gaol deliveries, elsewhere often mentioned, when crimi-

nous clerks were handed over by request to the charge of their
Diocesan, to be kept in his official prison at his pleasure, and
that sometimes for a long while. One such was lodged in
durance for seventeen years on the charge of having stolen two
dishes and a coverlet.¹ When such large numbers of all sorta
and conditions had the tonsure, there must have been offenders
in the diocese, and Cantilupe, with his strong sense of ecclesias-
tical rights, would certainly have claimed them.². No mention
again is made of the purgatioris by which such clerks were
allowed to clear themselves by their own eaths, and those of
friendly compurgators who were not crosa-examined.

Nothing is said of the Visitations of the parish churches, for
which it was by this time usual to make formal arrangements‚
at least once in three yearS, with due requirement of the
customary procuratione, and with much burdening at times of
unwilling hosts, as when the Bishop's neighbour of Worcester
stayed with one hundred and fifty horses at the Priory‚⁸ or
Grandisson of Exeter went to visit Cornwall with a train of
Dignitaries and a vast number of others (in multitudine
φορτιῑοιςα).4 We may regret the silence on this matter because
we lack the information we might else have as to the conditione
of parochial life, and the vigilance of Episcopal super-vision ;
such as we have elsewhere in notices of the shortcomings of
the parish priests, the defective supply of service books and
vestments‚ the enlargement of parish churches authoritatively
enforced‚ the coadjutore appointed by the Bishop to relieve
aged or disabled parsons, new ordinances to improve the
financial conditione of the Vicars‚ else starved by ‘the religious
houses, the rights of the mother churches jealously guarded
when private chapels were allowed for local magnates. It is
hard to believe that much was done in this way by the Bishop
when nothing was recorded, while so much space was given to
proceedings against non-residents and pluralists unprovided with
the purely formal dispensa-tions such as he himself enjoyed in

earlier years. The Register again does not supply details about
