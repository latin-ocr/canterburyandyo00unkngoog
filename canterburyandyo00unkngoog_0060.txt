Gonfimnations and ordinatione. xlv

the diocesan synode, to· which the clergy were all summoned to
appear in person or by proxy, when -their common interests
were to be discussed or Episcopal regulations published.

As to the ceremonies of Confirmation this Register, like
othere, is quite silent, though the injunctions of some Bishops speak
in peremptory terms, requiring parents to bring their young
children to their Diocesan wherever they could find him, under
pain of having to fast on bread and water every Friday till
the duty was discharged.¹ But with prelates so much on the
move it was not an easy task to find them. So Cantilupe,
we are told, was careful on his journeys to wear some of his
pontificale even as he rode along that when parents with
little ones appeared upon the road he might without delay
lay his hands upon them.² It was perhaps a somewhat rough
and ready system.

The Ordination lists are given of course with much detail,
even to the box of letters which is mentioned as the sole title
of one of those ordained. The Orders were conferi-ed in various
places in the diocese or elsewhere, as at Leominster, Ledbury‚
Newent‚ and Tottenham, but never, it appears, in Hereford
itself, which indeed he seldom visited and can hardly have
resided in at all. He seems to have made no use of the
Bishops with outlandish titles in partibus infidelium, whose
services were found convenient by others who were constantly
engaged in diplomacy or offices of state. The Cathedral
Chapter, as a whole, he never treated as his council, though
many of its members were in constant residence at this time ς
its collective judgment indeed he did not value- highly, if we
may trust certain disparaging remarks ;8 it was not yet purged
of the Burgundian leaven ς but some of the Canons were
regularly employed by him as Officials, Treasurer, Commissaries,
or Proctors. He did not air too publicly his mistrust of the
foreign clement, or let his agents in Rome be too outspoken.⁴
Even John de Aquablanca‚ the litigious Dean, left a little in
his will towards the outlay on the tomb of “ the blessed

Thomas.''⁶
