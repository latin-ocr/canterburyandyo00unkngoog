xlvi Introduction.

Cantilupe was vigorous in language, mighty in sequestrations
and in excommunicatione, but few details ane given of his
corrective jurisdiction over the laity. Other Bishops left record
of the penances imposed on deliberate offenders—the public
fustigations in the churchyard, as of the fifty seven at Yeovi13 ¹
the doleful processions of bare-footed and half-clad culprits with
the lighted candles32 the crusade enjoined for the abduction
of two nuns3⁸ but we do not learn how far Cantilupe was a
terror to evil doers, clerical or lay, except when the rights or
property of the Ghurch were in any danger. But if we miss
much that would throw light on the eeclesiastical or moral
condi‘tions of the times, we have ample details of the techni·
calities of litigation, congenial perhaps to the doctor utriusque
juris, but hardly quite becoming to a Saint.

Towards the end of 1279 the Bishop made arrangements
to leave England on some business not defined. His safe-
conduct and letters of protection were procured ; ⁴ his repre-
sentatives were appointed to transact official business in his
name 5 ⁶ his excuses were sent for non-appearance at eeclesias·
tical assemblies ς ⁰ and he travelled southwards into Kent, as
far at least as Ightham, from which letters are dated, '¹ but
then returned, giving up his intended journey, on which no
light is thrown by any information which we have. Next year
however events occurred, which resulted in a long absence from
his See. A matrimonial suit between Petronilla Bebler and
Richard de Bramford was brought before the Court of the
Dean's delegate—called the sub-dean—at Hereford. Richard,
against whom sentence was given, appealed to the Oourt of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, ignoring the inter-mediate
tribunal, that of the Bishop of the diocese. The sub-dean,
disregarding the prohibition to proceed which was sent to him
in due course, had Richard and his agent ari-ested, and flung
in the mud the letter of the Official of Canterbury, who had
fined him ten marks and insisted on his prompt obedienee.
Citations and excommunications followed ς then a mandate to
the official at Hereford, and finally to the Bishop himself,
under pain of suspension of his chapel and an interdict, if
proceedings against the sub-dean were not taken. When two
