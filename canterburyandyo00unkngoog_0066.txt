The stay in Normandy. xlix

We find him also at Poissy close to Paria where he might
wish to look in upon old friends.¹ He stayed a while at
Charenton to inspect the condition of some property which had
been acquired there by Bishop Peter‚² who had left it in his will
to the collegiata church which he founded and endowed at Aqua-
bella. A myster-icus claim was put in for him afterwards by william
de Cantilupe³ on the ground that the estate had been bought
with funds which belonged of right to the Church not to the
private property of his predecessor. It is hard to see what
evidence there could be of this, or why the claim should have
been delayed so long if it were well grounded. There is no
reference to any such flaw in the title in the letter which he
wrote on the subject of the dilapidations on the property to
Emeric the Ghancellor,⁴ who under his uncle’s will was trustee
for the estates of Aquabella.

During the whole of Cantilupe's stay in Nor-mandy, which
lasted from the summer of 1280 to the autumn of 1281, we
find nothing in the Register to explain his motives, not a word

about the disputed jurisdiction, or of any appeal to Rome on
the subject. The entries in Wilkins’ Concilia are silent as to

the issue of the conflict. Peckham himself took no active part
in it, though he vaguely refers in a later letter to the Bishop
as ‘⁸ skulking in foreign parts‚” and trying to secure Papal
orders against “ so-called aggressions of the Court of Canter-
bury.”⁵ What really passed we cannot tell, but it appears
that the Bishop on his way home waited on the Primate, and
by his unassuming manners raised hopes in· Peckham’s mind of
meek submissiveness in future dealings.⁶

Soon after his return there was fresh matter of dispute.
On the death of Henry de Hawkley, Canon of Hereford and
Lincoln, who had held benefices in various dioceses, the business
of probate was claimed by the Court of Canterbury as belong-
ing to its jurisdiction‚ and the Vicar of Rosa the Executor,
was cited to appear before it. Robert le Wyse, the Bishop’s
Official, refused to recognise this claim3 the Bishop himself
was then required to have a citation served upon the Vicar,

Peckham·s appointment.
