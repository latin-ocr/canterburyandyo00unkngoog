remainder.¹ He must have died soon after and disputes again
arose with his successor John de Swinfield ς in 1293 it was
decided to· refer the question to the arbitration of the Bishop.²

As early as April, 1290, Swinfield had addressed a letter to
Pope N icholas IV, urging the canonization of his predecessor.
In 1292 the Bishops of my, Durham‚ and Bath and Wells
made a like petition to Pope Celestine3 Swinfield wrote again
to the same effect in 1299. No answer appears to have been
received. In 1305 13118 Mag-nates of England sent a weighty
letter to Clement V, asking that the wonder-worker might be
canonized3³ this was signed by Edward 1., who also wrote
private letters on the subject to the Pope and to a Cardinal,⁴ after
special appeal had been made to him by the Bishop and the
Chapter of Η81·81“01·(1.5

A commission of inquiry into the life and miracles of
Cantilupe was then appointed, consisting of the Bishops of
London and Mende with the Nuncio in England, william de
Testa. These held their first meeting 011 JuJy 13, 1307, in
the Chapter House of St. Paul's. Their primary duty was to
ascertain how far the anathemas of Peckham and his official
had been pushed3 was Cantilupe really excommunicated by
them? The language of the Primate in his letters seems to
leave no doubt that the sentence had been issued ;⁶ but the
Commissioners, after seeing the official documenta of the Court
of Canterbury, and learning what had passed at Orvieto and
Monte Fiascone, decided that he was not actually excommuni-
cate at his death. Either the sentence was conditional as
pronounced, or the appeal to the Pope which had been already
made, or Papal absolution at a later stage, deprived the
sentence of its force. This preliminary question settled, the
commissionem—without the Nuncio——betook themselves to Here-
ford‚ where they stayed from August 30 to November 16,
witnessing themselves the concourse of pilgrims and the profuse
