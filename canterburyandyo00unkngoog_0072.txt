The Papal Commissioners at Hereford. lv

abundance of the offerings‚ and examining in the Chapel of St.
Catherine, which was between the Gathedral and the Pau-lace,
the witnesses who came before them to testify to the character
of the Bishop and to the miracles that had been wrought.

The four months allowed by the Pope for the inquiry wer‘e
nearly at an end when only seventeen of the marvels reported
had been thoroughly investigated‚ and the evidence of one
hundred and fifteen witnesses heard in their favour. Two
hundred and four more had been officially described3 as to
these they could do no more than accept the sworn statements
of Swinfield and others that they believed them to be genuine.
The whole record of the proceedings' was then sent to the Papal
Com-t, and from the documentary evidence thus preserved the
writer of 1116 life in the Acta Sanctorum—said to be Father
Suysken—drew up his detailed account of the career and
miracles of the Bishop. As to the reported marvels it is not
necessary to say much here 5¹ they may be left to the examina·-
tion of the curious in such matters. Of the sincerity of the
witnesses there seems to be no doubt 3 but Swinfield's own
evidence does 1101 allow us 10 rate the value of his judgment
in such questions very highly, and from others critical inquii-y
into the facts themselve8‚ or insight into the mysteries of
ner-vous maladies could hardly be expected.

After the report of the inquiry had been received no
further steps were taken by Clement V, and Swinfield passed
away without any sign that his hopes would be fulfilled.

The commissioners had reported that' the offeri'ngs at the
tomb had been so bountiful that they had provided for the
necessary outlay on two new naves (ἵ bays) in the Cathedral‚
and on some part of the great Tower.² This seems at first to
raise a difficulty, for the two bays most probably are those
on the East side of the North Transept‚ and we cannot suppose
that they were built after 1287, when the remains were trans-
ferred to the new tomb, at the time when, according to the
evidence of Swinfield, the fame of the miracles began to spread.
