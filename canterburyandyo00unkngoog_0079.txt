lx Introduction.

but they dwelt with equal servetur on qualities less winning to
our eyes—the survivals of the ideals of the past. Not only
did he grudge the body's simplest needs, and rise from table
alwayS, by his own admission‚ with a sense of unsatisfied
desire ς ¹ not only did he excite the admiration of his servante
by the filthy hair-shirt with its handful of lice that stirs our
loathing 3² but he shrank even from loving intercourse with
his own sistere, repelling their advances with a sort of Mani-
chean rigour, which became, it seemed‚ the Saint, but was
quite unlovely in the man. His friends said much of his
equanimity and patience, and there must have been something
genia] and winning to attract the sympathies and reverence
of men like Swinfield, Robert le Wyse, and Ralph de Hengham‚
to say nothing of his household servants, But we may wonder·
to see the signs of what we should else call a litigious and
unyielding temper, in which persoml antipathies were carried
far.⁸ We may note with regret that he denounced all social
intercourse with J ewish neighbours as the enemies of God and

man, for whose expulsion from the kingdom he was urgent; ⁴
he even begged with tears that he might retire from the

Council Chamber when it was once proposed to give a con-
verted J ew authority to punish Christian rogues.⁸

His ideal of charity was doubtless not confined to almsgiving,
nor his sels-denia] to mere asceticism, but pmjudice and obstinacy
had much to do with the litigation at Rome which drained
his purse and tried his temper. Incorruptible as a judge him-
self, he yet stooped to bribes to gain his cause, and proposed
to his representatives to move in crooked ways. ⁸ It startles
us ⁴to read that his confidential agent—not regarded as very
scrupulous by his rivale—begged him to dictate only such a
course of action as would be honourable and junt.⁸

The last English Saint recognised by the undivided Western
Church was still of the true medieval type, austere in his sels-
discipline‚ fearless in the assertion of the Church's seeming
rights, but narrow in his sympathieS‚ stern in his coercive
moods, with more of the spirit of a Dominio than of a Francis,

and ¹therefore somewhat unattractive to our modern tasteS.
