THE BISHOP'S INGOME.

 

The official income of izhe bishopric of Hereford is not put
st a. high figure in contemporary documents. 'I'he Taoeatio Nicholai
of 1291 returns it ιιι 2449 ls. 5d. in flemporsls alone, including
an item of 244 2s. 6²s,d., the vslue of property in izhe diocese of
Worcester et Prestbury, Pulcomb, and Sevenhamptom and another
of 210 for lsnd st Eston in Wiltshire‚ but omitting the vslue of
the house in London which was given ιο the See by Rslph of
Msidstone. In another account of bhe ssme survey izhe lsnds in
worcestershire and Wiltshire are not included, snd the whole
exceeds 2500 per annum.¹ Cantilupe had also by Pspsl grant
the income of tithes in Ledbury and Bosbury appropriated ιο his
table, on the ground of the meagre provision for s. Bishop’s
wants? Ιι was called indeed by Swinfield the worst endowed
Bishopric in Englsnd‚⁸ snd its twenty-three manors⁴ gsve but a.
modest sustzenance compared with the fifty of Winchestzer, some of
which were lsrge and rich. Lydbury North indeed covered s. great
extent of land but was returned st a. low velue, snd this was due
perhaps ιο its position on the Welsh border, where it was exposed
ιο plundering forays. 'I'hough the actual value of this income was
probably much lai-ger than the taxable amount, Cantilupe was s
poorer man ss Bishop than ss pluralist before, for he is said ιο
have derived from his various preferments s sum ss large ss his
episcopal income,⁵ and though he spent freely on the buildings of
his many parishes, and was munificent in charities, he- had time
ιο accumulate considerable ssvings. These he needed for the great
expensos of the first year or two of office, though he may not
have had, like Peckham and others who gained their Sees by
Papa-l provision, ιο pay great sums ιο the Court of Rome. His
predecessor died in debt, and money due for the cstizle ιο stock
the farms was not psid till September, 1278 3⁸ the charges on
account of dilapidatione were probably delayed if paid st all.
