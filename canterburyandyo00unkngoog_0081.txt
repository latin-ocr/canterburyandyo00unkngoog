lxii Introduction.

A large fine was paid by him for the custody 01 the manor 01
Earley, 66 also 101 the purchase of the waxdships in the Marmion
estateS, and these must have been drawn from private funds.
But the costly litigation caused by his ill-advised acceptance 01
the prebend 01 Preston, and his unwillingness to reinstate Peter -
de Langon when he vacated it himself, together with the dispute
as to jurisdiction with the Bishop 01 St. Asaph, brought vexa-
tion and embarassment that ended only with his life. Proctors
and advocates had to be paid, and presente given to Cardinals and
others who had to be conciliated3 such expenses were a constant
drain, and we find many indications 01 it in his letters· He bor-
rowed a hundred pounds from William de Rotherfield, Dean 01
York,¹ in 1276, and gave powers to Nicholas the Penitentiary to
contract a loan to that amount at Rome in 1278? The executore
01 1116 brother Hugh lent him 2102 66. 611. 111 1279 ;⁸ Peter of
Chester, Canon 01 the Gathedral, found him 6 hundred marks 3⁴
with the consent of the Chapter he took two hundred marks
from a reserve deposited in the treasury‚‘ and he was indebted to

John de Clare for eighty more!

There 616 110 signs indeed 01 extravagance or careless manage-
ment; his letter to his 8666661161τ implies a watchful serutiny of
1116 accounts and effective control 01 1116 financial agents. The
sum spent 011 the livery 01 1116 servants, though equivalent to four
hundred pounds,⁸ compares favourably with that, nearly six times
66 much, which Bishop Drokensiord paid 101 the same purpose.⁹
But an episcopal household was necessarily large; bailiffs and
farm-servants were numerous; repaire were costly in so many
11161101 1101166630 and the keep 01 the thirty 01· 111016 1101666 needed
to convey his retinue from one home to another could not· be dis-

pensed with.

It 16 difficult to ascertain the amount and sources 01 1116 private
income. of the very large landed estates 01 1116 family not much
seems to have been ever in his hands, except 101 a time 66
a guardian and trustes. We read 01 6 little messuage in Linooln-

lo—ln 1856 the Blshoo and Chapter passed a resolution that the 11011666 betonging to
the See and Chapter in Hereford and on the mauors were excessivo in number, expen-
sive to 1611611. und should not be a but-den on them. (Chapter Archim).
