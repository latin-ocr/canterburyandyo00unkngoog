His private property and lcqacies. lxiii

shire held under Edmund de Dynecourt ;¹ property in the Manor of
Barling was sold by him for sixty pounds in 1275‚¹ but the
bailiff had not settled his accounts in 1279.⁸ Money was due 10
him in Ireland‚⁴ and he had estates in Somersetshire! The
mention of a bailiff in Charlecote (? in Warwickshire) points
to lauded interests there ;⁸ so also do the entries respecting
Madresfield (near Worcester) and Bredenbury.⁷ He had also the
Manor of Berkham, which he sold to one of his pages, William
de Nevyle, for 240 166. ;⁸ the right of advowson of Alveston in
the diocese of Worcester⁹ is most easily explained by the possession
of a manor there. His frequent visits 10 Το151611116111 (Totenhale)¹⁰
may imply that he had a manor house in that neighbourhood, or
he may have accepted hospitality from the Prior ’01 Holy Trinity,
but 151116 16 only matter of conjecture. On the whole from the
very meagre references 10 him in the Hundred Rolls, or ima
mediately after his death in the State Records, we may gather
that his landed property was small. He had special licence to
deal in his Will with the Manor oi Earley‚¹¹ and his interest in
that passed to his sister J ulianam

His Wiu unfortunately 1166 1101 been preserved, but we have
a list of the many legacies bequeathed by him, mostly in small
sums, to his clerks and personal retainers.¹³ These amounted to
about four hundred and fifty 11161116, and were all paid in 1282.
When the long suit about the prebend of Preston was brought to
a close at Rome, sentence was pronounced that the executors of
Cantilupe were to repay Langon 5360 for every year in which the
Bishop had detained the prebend. But Swinfield and de Montiort,
the executore, shewed that they had nothing left of his estate.
They had laid out on his Obit what remained after payment of
the legacies,¹⁴ together with provision for his funeral and monu-
ment, and had secured discharge from the Gourt of Canterbury.²‘
